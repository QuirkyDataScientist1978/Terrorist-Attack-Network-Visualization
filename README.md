# Terrorist-Attack-Network-Visualization
An analysis of 9 terrorist attack networks across various countries between the years 2000 and 2005 using a Gephi network graph visualization with the goal of discovering patterns, similarities, connections, and potential relationships between one anotherâ€™s actors. Apart from Gephi, Python was used with the Pandas and Numpy libraries to clean, manipulate, and merge all 18 datasets (nodes & relations) into 2 master datasets: all_nodes and all_relations. A Prezi data story that captures the project's results and conclusions can be accessed through the following link:
